# ARIA
This is the artifact of paper A Component-Sensitive Static Analysis Based
Approach for Modeling Intents in Android Apps  accepted by ICSME 2023.
In this paper, we introduced a multi-level component-sensitive
static analysis technique to efficiently and accurately compute
Intent information in bundles of apps. In the first phase, our
approach models Intents that each component can send out
with placeholders for information coming from ICCs, and
then, in the second phase, it propagates ICC information
among the components in the bundle to compute the content
of Intents and ICCs.
